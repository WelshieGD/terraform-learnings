# git commit --amend --no-edit


```
git commit --amend --no-edit
```

The --no-edit option tells Git to make the change without changing the commit message. You can also use --amend to edit a commit message, to add files that were accidentally left out of the commit, or to remove files that were added by mistake.

Be careful \ don't use when sharing commits with others e.g. on github
